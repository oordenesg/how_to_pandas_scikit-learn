# how_to_pandas_scikit-learn

This repository shows examples of how to use the most famous Python libraries. Here you can find examples of data cleansing as well as data modeling. Before the check the code, what is Pandas? What is Numpy?

##  1. Pandas
Pandas is defined as an open-source library that provides high-performance data manipulation in Python. It is built on top of the NumPy package, which means Numpy is required for operating the Pandas. The name of Pandas is derived from the word Panel Data, which means an Econometrics from Multidimensional data. It is used for data analysis in Python and developed by Wes McKinney in 2008.

Before Pandas, Python was capable for data preparation, but it only provided limited support for data analysis. So, Pandas came into the picture and enhanced the capabilities of data analysis. It can perform five significant steps required for processing and analysis of data irrespective of the origin of the data, i.e., load, manipulate, prepare, model, and analyze.

## 2. NumPy
NumPy is mostly written in C language, and it is an extension module of Python. It is defined as a Python package used for performing the various numerical computations and processing of the multidimensional and single-dimensional array elements. The calculations using Numpy arrays are faster than the normal Python array.

The NumPy package is created by the Travis Oliphant in 2005 by adding the functionalities of the ancestor module Numeric into another module Numarray. It is also capable of handling a vast amount of data and convenient with Matrix multiplication and data reshaping.

Both the Pandas and NumPy can be seen as an essential library for any scientific computation, including machine learning due to their intuitive syntax and high-performance matrix computation capabilities. These two libraries are also best suited for data science applications.
