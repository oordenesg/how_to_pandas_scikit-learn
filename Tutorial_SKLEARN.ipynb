We will provide code implementations for one of the datasets and leave space for you to code implementations on a different dataset. Support is available via slack. \n","* Each section will have an exercise to help reinforce your learning. We suggest you:\n","   * Write out each line of code by hand (rather than copy and paste it from the relevant example) - this will improve your understanding of code syntax\n","   * Write out, above each line of code, an explanation as to what the code, using a comment `#` - this will improve your understanding of how the code works\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KA2bg4ruhi0G"},"source":["## 1.

Regularization \n","* When we train our models, we might need to prevent against **over-** or **underfitting**. Overfitting is when our model performs well on the training data but does not generalise to unseen data (such as our test set). The model might be too complex, with the parameter weights probably too large and aligned too closely to the patterns of the training data. The solution is to develop a means of reducing these weights during training, and this is done through a process called **regularization**.\n","* Underfitting is when our model is too simple to capture patterns in either the training or test sets. Chapters 3 and 10 of *Python Machine Learning* cover this topic in more detail.\n","* How we regularise the model depends on what estimator we are using. In most cases, we can penalise the increase in parameter weights as the model trains by inserting a regularization term to our model when we instantiate it. This is applicable to regression models, logistic regression and support vector classifiers (see below for implementations).  \n","* For these estimators, the regularization term is commonly either **L1 Regularization**, where the weights are reduced by a user defined parameter multiplied by the absolute value of the weights (or coefficients); or **L2 Regularization**, where the weights are reduced by a user defined parameter multiplied by the squared sum of the weights.\n","* For tree based models, such as Decision Trees and Random Forests, we can help prevent overfitting by adjusting parameters associated with the leaf and branch settings.\n","* Regularization is another reason why feature scaling such as standardization is important. For regularization to work properly, we need to ensure that all our features are on comparable scales.\n","* We implement L1 and L2 Regularization for regression models in this section. In Section 6, we implement  `RandomSearchCV` (explained below) on a `Logistic Regression` estimator.
